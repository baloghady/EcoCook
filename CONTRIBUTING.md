# Contributing to EcoCook

Thank you for your interest in this project! We're thrilled that our work has caught your attention.

## University Project Notice

This project is being developed as part of a university assignment with specific academic requirements. As such, we are **not accepting external contributions** at this time.

### Why Can't I Contribute?

- This is a graded academic project
- University policies require that only the original team members contribute to the codebase
- Accepting outside contributions would violate academic integrity guidelines
- The project must reflect solely the work of our team of 3 students

## Questions?

If you have questions about the project or want to discuss ideas, feel free to open a discussion or issue. While we can't accept code contributions, we're happy to chat about the project and its concepts.

## After the Academic Period

Once this project is submitted and graded, we may revisit our contribution policy. If you're still interested in contributing at that time, please check back!
